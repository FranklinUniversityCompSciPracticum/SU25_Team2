# E-Commerce Web Application

This is the team repository for SU25_Team 2

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack eCommerce website that allows users to browse and purchase products online. It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React JS, and Node JS) for both frontend and backend. The application provides an interactive user interface where customers can view products, manage their shopping cart, and register/login to make purchases. The backend manages product data and user authentication, while the admin panel offers functionality for managing products in the store

## Common Issues & Fixes

1. "Command Not Found" Errors
   If git or npm is not recognized:
   Ensure Git and Node.js are properly installed.

   Restart your terminal after installing them.

   Run these commands to verify installation:

   git -v # should return a Git version, e.g., git version 2.42.0
   node -v # should return a Node version, e.g., v22.1.0

   If these commands return a version number, the tools are installed correctly.

2. "Port 5173 is Already in Use"
   If you’re using Vite and get a port conflict:
   Close any running Vite instances or restart your computer.

   To use a different port:

   npm run dev -- --port 3000

   To check if a port (like 5173) is still in use:

   netstat -ano | findstr :5173

   If nothing is returned, the port is free and not in use.

3. "Module Not Found" Errors
   This means dependencies are missing or incorrectly installed.
   First, try:

   npm install

   If problems persist, reset your dependencies:

   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
